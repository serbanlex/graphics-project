% ABSTRACT
% ============================================
\begin{abstract}
This project explores the creative potential of modern AI image generation tools through the theme ``The Hero in Four Worlds'' — placing a consistent character across four dramatically different environments: a tropical jungle, a medieval town, a futuristic city, and a desert landscape. Using a combination of Seedream 4.5 \cite{seedream}, Nano Banana \cite{nanobanana}, and Flux Kontext \cite{fluxkontext}, we demonstrate a practical workflow for generating visually cohesive narratives while maintaining character consistency. The project evaluates each tool's strengths and weaknesses in terms of image quality, generation speed, creative flexibility, and consistency preservation. Results show that combining multiple specialized AI tools produces superior outcomes compared to using a single tool, with each platform excelling at different stages of the creative pipeline.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project Theme}

This project explores the theme \textbf{``The Hero in Four Worlds''} — creating a consistent character placed across four dramatically different environments:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Jungle} — Dense tropical vegetation, wildlife, natural lighting
    \item \textbf{Medieval Town} — Historical architecture, cobblestone streets, period-appropriate atmosphere
    \item \textbf{Futuristic City} — Neon lights, advanced technology, cyberpunk aesthetics
    \item \textbf{Desert} — Arid landscape, harsh sunlight, sand dunes and oasis
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Purpose of the Project}

This theme was chosen to test the capabilities of modern AI image generation tools in maintaining character consistency across vastly different environmental contexts. The challenge lies in placing the same hero character in four visually distinct worlds while preserving their identity, clothing, and features. This project demonstrates the practical workflow of combining multiple AI tools for creative visual storytelling.

\subsection{Objectives}

The primary objectives of this project are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Generate 4 distinct world environment landscapes using AI tools
    \item Generate a consistent hero character design using AI image generation tools
    \item Place the character in 4 distinct world environments (7-10 total images)
    \item Evaluate and compare the performance of Seedream 4.5, Nano Banana, and Flux Kontext
    \item Document the creative workflow and analyze tool strengths/weaknesses
    \item Create a compelling visual narrative across all four worlds
\end{itemize}

% 2. TOOLS OVERVIEW
% ============================================
\section{Tools Overview}

This section describes the AI tools used in this project, their capabilities, and their specific roles in the creative workflow.

\subsection{Seedream 4.5 (ByteDance)}

\textbf{Official Website:} \url{https://seed.bytedance.com/en/seedream4_5}\\
\textbf{Access Platform:} \url{https://lovart.ai} (Seedream 4.5 integration) \cite{lovart}

\subsubsection{Description}
Seedream 4.5 is ByteDance's advanced AI image generation model, known for producing high-resolution, photorealistic images with excellent detail and composition. It excels at generating complex scenes with multiple elements, dramatic lighting, and cinematic compositions. The model responds well to structured prompts following the formula: Subject + Environment + Style + Technical Specs.

\subsubsection{Role in Project}
Used as the primary tool for generating all four world landscape backgrounds (Jungle, Desert, Medieval Town, Futuristic City). Seedream 4.5 was chosen for its ability to create detailed, high-resolution environments in 16:9 landscape format suitable for desktop wallpaper quality.

\subsection{Nano Banana}

\textbf{Website:} \url{https://gemini.google.com/} (Google Gemini)

\subsubsection{Description}
Nano Banana is an AI-powered image editing platform specialized in maintaining character and object consistency across multiple images. It allows users to upload reference images and seamlessly insert consistent elements into new scenes.

\subsubsection{Role in Project}
Used for inserting the hero character into all four world landscapes while maintaining consistent appearance. Also tested for in-context editing comparisons alongside Flux-2 Pro.

\subsection{Flux Kontext}

\textbf{Website:} \url{https://flux-context.org/}

\subsubsection{Description}
Flux Kontext is a context-aware AI image editing tool that excels at making local, targeted edits to images while preserving the overall composition. It is particularly useful for fine adjustments, background modifications, and adding/removing specific details.

\subsubsection{Role in Project}
Used for in-context editing experiments including holographic effects, pose changes, and adding story elements. Demonstrated excellent quality preservation compared to Nano Banana.

\subsection{Additional Tools}

\textbf{lovart.ai} — Web platform providing access to Seedream 4.5 with a user-friendly interface. Used as the primary access point for Seedream due to its intuitive controls and aspect ratio settings.

% ============================================
\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Workflow Overview}

The project follows a three-phase approach: first generating all world landscapes, then creating a consistent hero character, and finally compositing the character into each world with refinements.

\end{minipage}
}
\caption{Three-phase workflow diagram}
\label{fig:workflow}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Phase 1:} Generate all four world landscapes with designated ``hero spots'' — areas where the character will be placed later (stone pedestal in jungle, empty camel saddle in desert, etc.)

\textbf{Phase 2:} Create the hero character reference and use Nano Banana to insert them consistently into each landscape.

\textbf{Phase 3:} Use Flux Kontext for final adjustments, lighting fixes, and detail enhancement.

\subsection{Order of Tools Used}

\subsection{In-Context Editing Comparison}

This section compares in-context editing capabilities between Flux-2 Pro and Nano Banana using the same prompt on the cyberpunk scene.

\subsubsection{Edit Objective}

The primary objective of this in-context edit was to add a story-critical element—a holographic lion spirit projection emanating from the character's ring—while strictly preserving the hero's identity, clothing, and background environment. The comparison evaluates how each tool handles the integration of new, translucent elements and lighting effects without altering the existing high-resolution source image.

Detailed prompts for this and other world edits are documented in Section~\ref{sec:incontextprompts}.

\subsubsection{Cyberpunk Hologram — Flux-2 Pro}

See Figure~\ref{fig:flux_edit}.

\noindent\textbf{Observations:} Resolution maintained at high quality. Hologram placement less intuitive but output remains crisp and detailed.

\subsection{Visual Story Summary}

The hero's journey begins in the primordial jungle, where atop a sunlit stone plateau, he receives a mystical ring from ancient spirits while a lion watches with knowing eyes. Empowered by this artifact, he travels to a medieval kingdom where he becomes a knight champion, facing opponents in jousting tournaments with fierce determination. His adventures continue through the scorching desert, riding camelback with the spirit of his lion companion manifesting from the ring as a ghostly guide. Finally, in the distant future, he stands on a cyberpunk rooftop overlooking a neon-lit megacity, the lion now appearing as a holographic projection from his ring — a luminous memory of where his journey began.

\subsection{Strengths and Weaknesses}

\textbf{Seedream 4.5:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Excellent photorealistic quality for landscape generation
    \item Very consistent outputs matching prompt specifications
    \item Best tool for initial background/scene creation
    \item Fast generation times
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Nano Banana:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Good for character compositing and insertion tasks
    \item More logical and intuitive element positioning
    \item Quality and resolution reduction observed in outputs
    \item Slight cartoonization of photorealistic source images
    \item Often changes angles/positions, requiring multiple prompt retries
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Flux-2 Pro:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Excellent resolution and quality preservation
    \item Creative interpretation of in-context editing prompts
    \item Best overall in-context editing quality
    \item Sometimes alters character identity (extra limbs, facial changes)
    \item Edit positioning can be less intuitive than expected
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Issues Encountered}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Resolution drop during Nano Banana compositing:} The first hero composite (desert scene) exhibited noticeably lower resolution compared to the original Seedream-generated background.
    
    \item \textbf{Character identity changes in Flux-2 edits:} Desert and jungle in-context edits altered the hero's appearance significantly, including an extra arm artifact in the jungle scene and facial changes in the desert scene.
    
    \item \textbf{Angle/position changes in Nano Banana:} The tool frequently modified camera angles and element positions despite explicit instructions to preserve the background exactly, requiring multiple prompt retries.
    
    \item \textbf{Quality stylization in Nano Banana:} Photorealistic source images became slightly cartoonish after processing, losing some of the original photorealism.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solutions Applied:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enhanced prompts with explicit quality and resolution preservation instructions
    \item Used Flux-2 Pro for quality-critical in-context edits
    \item Multiple iterations to achieve acceptable results
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Character Consistency Analysis}

Character consistency proved to be an interesting challenge in this project. While Seedream 4.5 generated the initial hero reference sheet with highly distinctive features (sharp jawline, hazel-green eyes, goatee, slicked-back hair, tattoo, black ring), maintaining these features varied based on edit complexity.

For simpler in-context edits, both tools performed well. The medieval rearing horse edit successfully preserved the hero's identity while changing the horse's pose — demonstrating that these tools can maintain character consistency when the requested changes are straightforward.

However, more complex edits involving additional elements (holographic lions, mystical effects, spirit companions) caused both Nano Banana and Flux-2 Pro to alter the character's appearance more significantly. The desert ghost lion edit resulted in noticeable identity changes in both tools.

\textbf{Key Finding:} Current AI in-context editing tools work well for simple pose/element changes but struggle with complex multi-element edits while preserving character identity. Simpler is better for consistency.

\section{Conclusions}

\subsection{Lessons Learned}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Start with the best generation tool:} Seedream 4.5 produces the highest quality base images — invest time in getting the initial landscapes perfect before attempting compositing or editing.
    
    \item \textbf{Design ``hero spots'' intentionally:} Empty saddles, stone plateaus, and rooftop edges made character insertion much easier than trying to add characters to busy scenes. Plan for insertion during background generation.
    
    \item \textbf{Simpler edits = better consistency:} Complex in-context edits (adding multiple elements, special effects) often alter character identity. Keep edits focused and simple for best results.
    
    \item \textbf{Use explicit constraints in prompts:} Phrases like ``DO NOT MODIFY the character's appearance'' and ``KEEP BACKGROUND EXACTLY AS IS'' significantly improved results. The more specific and emphatic the constraints, the better the tools respected them.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Best Practices Identified}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create detailed character reference sheets with multiple angles before starting any compositing work
    \item Use explicit ``DO NOT MODIFY'' instructions in prompts to protect background and character elements from unwanted changes
    \item Test complex edits in multiple tools (both Flux-2 and Nano Banana) and compare results before finalizing
    \item Build scenes with intentional insertion points (empty spaces, waiting mounts) for easier character compositing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ideas for Extensions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Add more world environments (underwater, space, post-apocalyptic, etc.)
    \item Create animation sequences transitioning between worlds
    \item Develop hybrid workflows combining multiple tools for optimal results
    \item Explore video generation tools for animated storytelling
    \item Test newer AI models as they release for improved character consistency
\end{itemize}
