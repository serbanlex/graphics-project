% ABSTRACT
% ============================================
\begin{abstract}
This project explores the creative potential of modern AI image generation tools through the theme ``The Hero in Four Worlds'' — placing a consistent character across four dramatically different environments: a tropical jungle, a medieval town, a futuristic city, and a desert landscape. Using a combination of Seedream 4.5 \cite{seedream}, Nano Banana \cite{nanobanana}, and Flux Kontext \cite{fluxkontext}, we demonstrate a practical workflow for generating visually cohesive narratives while maintaining character consistency. The project evaluates each tool's strengths and weaknesses in terms of image quality, generation speed, creative flexibility, and consistency preservation. Results show that combining multiple specialized AI tools produces superior outcomes compared to using a single tool, with each platform excelling at different stages of the creative pipeline.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project Theme}

This project explores the theme \textbf{``The Hero in Four Worlds''} — creating a consistent character placed across four dramatically different environments:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Jungle} — Dense tropical vegetation, wildlife, natural lighting
    \item \textbf{Medieval Town} — Historical architecture, cobblestone streets, period-appropriate atmosphere
    \item \textbf{Futuristic City} — Neon lights, advanced technology, cyberpunk aesthetics
    \item \textbf{Desert} — Arid landscape, harsh sunlight, sand dunes and oasis
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Purpose of the Project}

This theme was chosen to test the capabilities of modern AI image generation tools in maintaining character consistency across vastly different environmental contexts. The challenge lies in placing the same hero character in four visually distinct worlds while preserving their identity, clothing, and features. This project demonstrates the practical workflow of combining multiple AI tools for creative visual storytelling.

\subsection{Objectives}

The primary objectives of this project are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Generate 4 distinct world environment landscapes using AI tools
    \item Generate a consistent hero character design using AI image generation tools
    \item Place the character in 4 distinct world environments (7-10 total images)
    \item Evaluate and compare the performance of Seedream 4.5, Nano Banana, and Flux Kontext
    \item Document the creative workflow and analyze tool strengths/weaknesses
    \item Create a compelling visual narrative across all four worlds
\end{itemize}

% 2. TOOLS OVERVIEW
% ============================================
\section{Tools Overview}

This section describes the AI tools used in this project, their capabilities, and their specific roles in the creative workflow.

\subsection{Seedream 4.5 (ByteDance)}

\textbf{Official Website:} \url{https://seed.bytedance.com/en/seedream4_0}\\
\textbf{Access Platform:} \url{https://lovart.ai} (Seedream 4.5 integration) \cite{lovart}

\subsubsection{Description}
Seedream 4.5 is ByteDance's advanced AI image generation model, known for producing high-resolution, photorealistic images with excellent detail and composition. It excels at generating complex scenes with multiple elements, dramatic lighting, and cinematic compositions. The model responds well to structured prompts following the formula: Subject + Environment + Style + Technical Specs.

\subsubsection{Role in Project}
Used as the primary tool for generating all four world landscape backgrounds (Jungle, Desert, Medieval Town, Futuristic City). Seedream 4.5 was chosen for its ability to create detailed, high-resolution environments in 16:9 landscape format suitable for desktop wallpaper quality.

\subsection{Nano Banana}

\textbf{Website:} \url{https://nanobanana.ai/}

\subsubsection{Description}
Nano Banana is an AI-powered image editing platform specialized in maintaining character and object consistency across multiple images. It allows users to upload reference images and seamlessly insert consistent elements into new scenes.

\subsubsection{Role in Project}
Used for inserting the hero character into all four world landscapes while maintaining consistent appearance, clothing, and features across different environments. \todo{Update after using the tool}

\subsection{Flux Kontext}

\textbf{Website:} \url{https://flux-context.org/}

\subsubsection{Description}
Flux Kontext is a context-aware AI image editing tool that excels at making local, targeted edits to images while preserving the overall composition. It is particularly useful for fine adjustments, background modifications, and adding/removing specific details.

\subsubsection{Role in Project}
Used for final polish and context-aware edits such as lighting adjustments, adding environmental details, and fixing any artifacts from the character insertion process. \todo{Update after using the tool}

\subsection{Additional Tools}

\textbf{lovart.ai} — Web platform providing access to Seedream 4.5 with a user-friendly interface. Used as the primary access point for Seedream due to its intuitive controls and aspect ratio settings.

% ============================================
\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Workflow Overview}

The project follows a three-phase approach: first generating all world landscapes, then creating a consistent hero character, and finally compositing the character into each world with refinements.

\end{minipage}
}
\caption{Three-phase workflow diagram}
\label{fig:workflow}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Phase 1:} Generate all four world landscapes with designated ``hero spots'' — areas where the character will be placed later (stone pedestal in jungle, empty camel saddle in desert, etc.)

\textbf{Phase 2:} Create the hero character reference and use Nano Banana to insert them consistently into each landscape.

\textbf{Phase 3:} Use Flux Kontext for final adjustments, lighting fixes, and detail enhancement.

\subsection{Order of Tools Used}

Table~\ref{tab:toolorder} shows the sequential order in which tools were applied throughout the project.
